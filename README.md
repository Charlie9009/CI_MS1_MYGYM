# MyGym

## Welcome to my site [MyGym](https://charlie9009.github.io/CI_MS1_MYGYM/)!
<br>
MyGym is a site that wants to increase peoples wellbeing and motivate others by offering personal trainers and online videos. Due to Covid, MyGym wants to help people who now struggle with working out. Either by not working out at all, or alone in the wrong way not getting the help needed. By using MyGym they will be able to work out from home in a safe and effective way. <br>
The site is targeted towards everyone that wants to increase their health and/or wants help to get started with their training. The site is also for people who wants to explore new ways of working out by not being able to go to the gym. MyGym offers a wide variation of group training which can be booked from the site. What makes MyGym special is that we dont allow more than 10 people per personal trainer. This makes it possible for the trainer to tailor the best workout for every customer.

## Features

* **Navigation bar, Footer section**

    * The navigation bar and the footer are featured on all four pages and they are responsive. The navigation bar shows links to the Logo, Home, Schedule, Videos, Contact and a Login button. When on smaller screen sizes the login button will dissapear to allow for a clean and user friendly site. The login button is a pop up modal, so when you click it there will be a pop up window in the middle of the screen.
    * The footer shows Contact info, Social media icons, Athlean X link and MyGyms location. When on smaller screen sizes the footer will only show a link to the contact page and social media icons to make the footer easily navigated.

## Design choices

* Colors

    * I didn't want a white background so I tested a couple of colors and landed on a greyish blue. I chose that because it felt like it didn't take to much attention but still gave the background a little personality.

    * I gave the logo and the nav bar a black color, they were big and visual already. Then I also gave the reading material a black color to make it easy to read.

    * I gave the login button both in the top right corner and in the carousel a different styling to make it easy to spot. The top right corner has a black container and the text is white. The login button in the Carousel has a white container and black text.

    * In the Carousel I gave the text for the different images different colors to contrast the colors in the images.

    * The text I wanted to pop out a bit more I gave the color white.

    * To help the user to navigate easier I gave hover functions to the Logo, Nav bar, login button, all the anchor elements and the submit and reset button for the forms.

    * The colors I gave for the different workouts in the Schedule was picked to make them pop out of the other content. A slightly darker tone was picked so it would be a contrast.

* Fonts

    * I early on picked the font **Quicksand** and I stuck with that font throughout the project because I liked it. For the backup I picked **Sans-serif**.

## Design

* Most of my design choices came pretty early on the developement, I tested quite bit in Balsamiq and got a core design with four pages. Two of my design choices in the beginning was a big hero image with a lot of information and a login page, so my Mentor suggested me to make a carousel for the hero image and a modal for the login which I thought sounded challenging but a very good idea.<br>
Some of my choices came in the end of my project when I started experimenting because I didn't like some things and that led to me changing more.
One of those things was the Logo, Nav bar and login button. I had a more split version for a long period where the elements were far away from eachother and didn't really go together. So I started experimenting and got a better result.<br>
I struggled for a time with the contrast of the colors as well, but after some trial and error I managed to put my vision together.

### Features left to implement

* **Personal trainers**

    * A section with information about all of the personal trainers.

* **Group training**

    * A section with information about every single group workout offered at the gym and a layout of how every session could look like.

## Further testing

* The website has been inspected thru the device toolbar in chrome.

* I have tested the website thru phones like One Plus 8T and Iphone XR.

* Friends and family has been asked to review the site.

## Known bugs

* Login in, and signing up does not work. This is something that will be developed later.

* Submitting the Schedule Form or the Question Form does not work. This will also be developed later.

## Squashed bugs

* For a while I had problems with the bootstrap and Javascript overriding my own CSS rules. I fixed it by placing my CSS stylesheet beneath the other links to have more priority.

* The code for the carousel had an extra incomplete div tag which I removed.

* I used Iframes for the videos in this project and I had paragraphs within those Iframes "*Sorry, your browser does not support Iframes*". But text within the Iframes did not go thru the validator so I removed them.

## Deployment

* The site was deployed to github pages.

    1. In your repository find the settings button and click it.
    2. Scroll down to GitHub Pages, beneath it says "Pages settings now has its own dedicated tab! Check it out here!" Click on "Check it out here".
    3. Find source and from the drop-down menu select master from branch, click save, let it update.
